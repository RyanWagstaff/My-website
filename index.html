  <h2>Baby back ribs! these ribs were made by the city's rib pioneer  John Mills, who in the late 1920s opened a barbecue stand on 4th Street, just around the corner from the famous nightlife district on Beale. He cooked his ribs on a charcoal-fired brick pit in the alley out back and mopped them with a peppery hot sauce and are made from babys ribs... Just kiding there from the top of the rib cage between the spine and the spare ribs, below the loin muscle of a pig.</h2>
